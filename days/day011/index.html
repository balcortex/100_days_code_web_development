    <p class="definition center black-text">A CSS class is an attribute used to define a group of HTML elements to apply unique styling and formatting to those elements with CSS.</p>
    <p>To define a class, use the attribute class in the start tag of an element, followed by the name of the class within quotes. You can use any name, except it must not contain any spaces (the explanation is next).</p>
    <p class="center">HTML elements can belong to several classes. To add another class to an HTML element, use a space as a separator and add the name(s) of the other class(es). There is virtually no restriction in the number of classes you can use, but use them wisely.</p>
    <p class="black-text">You can still apply the Type CSS Selectors and refine the overall style later with Class CSS Selectors.</p>
    <p class="red-text">To define a class selector in CSS, use a dot (.) before the class name.</p>
