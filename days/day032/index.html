    <h1>Flexbox: Main Axis and Cross Axis</h1>
    <p>The reason <em>justify-content</em> and <em>align-items</em> behave differently when the value of <em>flex-direction</em> is <em>row</em> or <em>column</em> is that the flexbox container is designed to have a main axis and a cross axis. The <em>flex-direction</em> property defines the main axis, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it.</p>

    <p>Everything on flexbox refers to these axes, so it is worth understanding how they work.</p>

    <p>When the value of <em>flex-direction</em> is <em>row</em>, the main axis runs from left to right (for most languages) and the cross axis from top to bottom:</p>

    <p>When the value of <em>flex-direction</em> is <em>column</em>, the main axis runs from top to bottom and the cross axis from left to right (again, language dependant):</p>

    <img src="img/column.png" alt="The main and cross axis on a column flex container">

    <p>So, the two properties we've already covered act on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>justify-content</em>: main axis</li>
        <li><em>align-items</em>: cross axis</li>
    </ul>
