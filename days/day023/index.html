    <h1>Flexbox</h1>

    <p>There are many ways to move elements around on a web page.</p>
    <p>Flexbox (flexible box layout mode) is a relatively new way of manipulating elements in CSS, and its debut was revolutionary. Many modern web pages use flexbox to re-arrange elements, mostly on navigation links (headers and footers).</p>
    <p>Flexbox arranges elements into a single row by default. The elements within this row will flex (i.e., grow or shrink) based on the rules you define.</p>
    <p>For example, suppose we have three div elements (with the default block display property). Without using flexbox, the items will be shown like this:</p>

    <p>Without flexbox:</p>
    <div>(1) Item</div>
    <div>(2) Item</div>
    <div>(3) Item</div>

    <p>By using the flexbox layout, the result is the following:</p>
    <div class="flex-container">
        <div>(1) Flex-item</div>
        <div>(2) Flex-item</div>
        <div>(3) Flex-item</div>
    </div>

    <p>To use the flexbox layout mode, use the display property with the flex value.</p>
    <p>In flexbox, the element that uses the display: flex property is called the flex-container (the pink rectangle), and the elements within the flex-container (blue rectangles) are called the flex-items.</p>
