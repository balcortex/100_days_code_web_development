    <h1>Flexbox Growing</h1>
    <p>The default behavior of the flex-items is to inherit the size properties of their element. For example, by turning the container into a flex-container, the flex-items are set next to each other, wrapping their content, and without growing: </p>
    <div class="flex-container">
        <div>Item 1</div>
        <div>Item 2</div>
        <div>Item 3</div>
    </div>
    <p>To make the flex-items grow to absorb any extra space in the flex-container, use the flex-grow property with a value of 1. This rule will make all the items grow and have the same width:</p>
    <div class="flex-container grow" >
        <div>Item 1 (grow: 1)</div>
        <div>Item 2 (grow: 1)</div>
        <div>Item 3 (grow: 1)</div>
    </div>
    <p>Other values different from 1 can be used, too. For example, item 2 below has a flex-grow value of 3, meaning it will grow faster than the rest of the items in the flex-container. The exact ratio of their widths is 1/5, 3/5, and 1/5 (because items 1 and 3 have a flex-grow value of 1, so the total width is divided by the sum of all values, that is 5, and multiplied by the item's value):</p>
    <div class="flex-container grow">
        <div>Item 1 (grow: 1)</div>
        <div class="triple-size">Item 2 (grow: 3)</div>
        <div>Item 3 (grow: 1)</div>
    </div>
    <p>You can use decimal values to make that item smaller than the others:</p>
    <div class="flex-container grow">
        <div>Item 1 (grow: 1)</div>
        <div class="half-size">Item 2 (grow: 0.2)</div>
        <div>Item 3 (grow: 1)</div>
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top: 40px;"><strong>Note:</strong> in these examples, the items will start growing until space is available. When there's no space to grow, the items will be the same size (that's the beauty of flexbox).</p>
