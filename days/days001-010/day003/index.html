      There are several ways to make changes in the visual style of text. For
      beginners, this can be done in HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first option is using the <b>bold</b> &ltb&gt&lt/b&gt and
      <i>italics</i> &lti&gt&lt/i&gt tags. This option only affects the visual
      style.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, several people use screen readers for accessibility. For this
      reason, two other tags were introduced:
      <strong>strong</strong> &ltstrong&gt&lt/strong&gt and
      <em>emphasis</em> &ltem&gt&lt/em&gt tags. These tags change the visual
      style of the text, but also its semantics, meaning that screen readers
      will change their tone of voice to pronounce words within these tags.
