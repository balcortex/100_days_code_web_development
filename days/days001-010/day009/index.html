    <h1>External CSS Style</h1>
    <p>The use of Internal CSS is considered a better practice than Inline CSS because it uses less code and is easier to modify since all the styles are located in one section of the file.</p>
    <p>While Internal CSS can work well with simple, one-page websites, but once the website starts to grow and pages start to pile up, you need to open and modify each of the html files. If your website has 20 different pages, you need to make 20 additional modifications. And, of course, this can lead to errors.</p>
    <p>The solution is to use External CSS and link the style to each page. In this way, despite having many pages, you only need to modify one file.</p>
    <p>The syntax is similar to that of CSS Internal, just written in a different file. To use the CSS file, you need to link it in the head element using the following code: &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="path_to_style_file"&gt;. The path to the file can be internal or external so that you can use CSS files directly from the web.</p>
