    <h1>Positive and negative margins</h1>
    <p>Margins can have positive and negative values.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a positive margin to create space between boxes (push away other elements).</li>
        <li>Use a negative margin to reduce the distance between boxes (bring the elements closer).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, consider the following two HTML elements: the background and border are colored. The first box has a top-margin of 40px, so it has more space at the top than usual; the other margins are 20px on the left (separated from the edge of the page) and 20px on the bottom.</p>
    <p>The other box has a top-margin of negative 20px, pushing this box 20 pixels up (bringing the two boxes together). Also, it has a negative margin on the left, which pushes the box to the left, leaving a part of the box outside the visible part of the page.</p>
    <div class="positive">Positive margins</div>
    <div class="negative">Negative margins</div>
    <p>This flexibility in the margins allows us to move the boxes freely on the page.</p>
