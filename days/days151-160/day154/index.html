  <h1>Day 154 - CSS: Grid - Pt. 7</h1>

  <h3>Grid lines</h3>

  <p>Whenever we create grid tracks, grid lines are created implicitly. These grid lines are used to position grid items.</p>

  <p>Every grid has start and end lines. The lines are numbered from left to right and top to bottom, starting at 1. So, in a 2x2 grid, the columns range from 1 to 3, as well as the horizontal lines.</p>

  <h3>Positioning - Multiple Columns</h3>

  <p>We can set the column where it starts and ends using the <strong>grid-column-start</strong> and <strong>grid-column-end</strong> properties on the actual item.</p>

  <p>Suppose you have a 2x2 grid with three items and want the first item to span two columns. To achieve this, you must set the start of the item to 1 and the end to 3 (the line number 2 is the middle):</p>

  <code>
    #item1 {<br>
      <span class="code-highlight">
        &emsp;grid-column-start: 1;<br>
        &emsp;grid-column-end: 3;<br>
      </span>
    }<br>
  </code>

  <p>If any item doesn't have an explicit position, it is placed normally on the grid:</p>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="item" id="item1">Item 1</div>
    <div class="item">Item 2</div>
    <div class="item">Item 3</div>
  </div>
