    <h1>JavaScript: Hello World!</h1>
    <p>As with all programming languages, the first task is to make a simple program that prints "Hello World!" to ensure everything works.</p>

    <p>To include JavaScript code, put it inside a <em>script</em> tag. JavaScript code can be inserted almost anywhere into an HTML, and it will automatically executed when the browser processes the tag.</p>

    <p>There are several ways to make a "Hello World!" program; the most straightforward is using the <em>console.log()</em> function. This function won't display directly to the user but to the console. Anyway, it is sufficient to make our first web page which runs JavaScript.</p>

    <p>The following paragraph is a <strong>copy</strong> of the code inserted in the HTML file, which won't be visible directly in the web page rendering.</p>

    <p><code>&lt;script&gt; console.log('Hello World!'); &lt;/script&gt;</code></p>

    <script>console.log('Hello World!');</script>

    <p>To view the output, open the Developer Tools Panel (usually with the F12 key) and select Console. You should see the output "Hello World!".</p>
