    <h1>JavaScript</h1>

    <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages, like displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated graphics.</p>

    <p>It is the third layer, HTML and CSS being the other two, of the layer cake of standard web technologies. The three layers build on top of one another nicely.</p>

    <p>JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.</p>

    <p>The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads. They don't need special preparation or compilation to run. In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.</p>

    <p class="note">(When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.)</p>
    
    <p>What can JavaScript do?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Change the existing content, modify styles.</li>
        <li>React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.</li>
        <li>Send requests, download and upload files.</li>
        <li>Ask questions to the visitor, show messages.</li>
    </ul>
