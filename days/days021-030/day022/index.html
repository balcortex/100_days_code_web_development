    <h1>(1) Normal Flow</h1>
    <p>(2) The standard way to allocate elements on the page is called the <strong>(3) Normal Flow</strong>, which is <em>(4) top to bottom and left to right</em> (except for languages like Hebrew or Arabic).</p>
    <p>(5) Block elements will be placed one below the other, and inline elements will be placed on the right if there's enough space or below another if there isn't enough space.</p>
    <p>(6) All the elements on this page are numbered and should appear in the order declared in the code.</p>
    <p>(7) There are several ways to alter the normal flow, one of which is using the <em>(8) position</em> property. For example, <span class="float">(9) this block</span> will appear way below its original position.</p>
    <p>(10) By only using the Normal Flow, only very basic (and not very appealing) web pages can be made. Altering the normal flow allows us to create complex and more attractive designs.</p>
