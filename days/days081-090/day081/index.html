    <h1>Day 81 - Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors</h1>
    <p>In the next few days, I will be working on developing a web page that lets you play the `Rock, Paper, Scissors` game against the computer.</p>
    <p>I've started with a basic user interface (UI) composed of three buttons and a text field. The buttons let you choose between the three possible options. The text field is used to output the selected option (I could have used the console to log the user choice, but I want to make a video to show the functioning, and displaying the output on the webpage itself is more convenient for this purpose).</p>
    <p>Let's start with the HTML document, which is straightforward. The buttons are conveniently grouped within a div, which would allow the use of a for loop to attach the event listener. The other element is the text field:</p>
    <code>
    &lt;div id="buttons"&gt;<br>
    &emsp;&lt;button id="rock"&gt;Rock&lt;/button&gt;<br>
    &emsp;&lt;button id="paper"&gt;Paper&lt;/button&gt;<br>
    &emsp;&lt;button id="scissors"&gt;Scissors&lt;/button&gt;<br>
    &lt;/div&gt;<br>
    &lt;p id="player-choice"&gt;You chose: &lt;/p&gt;<br>
    </code>
    <p>In the JavaScript file, first, we query all the buttons, which are the children of the div whose id=`buttons`. Next, we loop over the buttons array (an HTML collection, to be precise) to attach the event listener to each button. The listener is a simple function that, for now, updates the text field to output the choice corresponding to the button pressed:</p>
    <code>
    const buttons = document.querySelector('#buttons').children;<br>
    <span class="comment">// all the children (buttons) of the div with id='buttons</span>'<br>
    const playerChoiceField = document.querySelector('#player-choice');<br><br>

    for (btn of buttons) {<br>
    &emsp;btn.addEventListener('click', playerSelection);<br>
    }<br><br>

    function playerSelection() {<br>
    &emsp;playerChoiceField.textContent = `You chose: ${this.id}`;<br>
    }<br>
    </code>
    <p>The result should be similar to:</p>
    <div id="buttons">
        <button id="rock">Rock</button>
        <button id="paper">Paper</button>
        <button id="scissors">Scissors</button>
    </div>
    <p id="player-choice">You chose: </p>
</body>
