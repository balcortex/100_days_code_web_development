# 100_days_code_web_development

My progress through the 100 Days of Code Challenge to learn Full-Stack Web Development

## Day 001 - 2023/09/3

Today, I learned how The Internet works: the purpose of the routers, modems, DNS names, and IP addresses. As I am following 'The Project Odin' course, I also installed Linux as a virtual machine and the required software (VS Code, Chrome, Git). In the end, I created my very first web page.

## Day 002 - 2023/09/4

Today, I learned several things:

* The home page should be named 'index.html'.
* The head tag should not contain any element that displays content (only metadata).
* Several hierarchical headings go from h1 to h6. In addition to making the text the biggest and boldest, the h1 tag is used by search indexers to locate the most crucial information about the webpage.
* Break lines and multiple spaces are comprised into a single whitespace. The 'p' tag is used to break several paragraphs.

## Day 003 - 2023/09/5

Today, I learned how to apply visual style (bold and italics) to text. The preferred way is using <strong> and <em> because these tags also change the semantics (the way screen readers pronounce the words).
