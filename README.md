# 100_days_code_web_development

My progress through the 100 Days of Code Challenge to learn Full-Stack Web Development

## Day 001 - 2023/09/03

Today, I learned how The Internet works: the purpose of the routers, modems, DNS names, and IP addresses. As I am following 'The Project Odin' course, I also installed Linux as a virtual machine and the required software (VS Code, Chrome, Git). In the end, I created my very first web page.

## Day 002 - 2023/09/04

Today, I learned several things:

* The home page should be named 'index.html'.
* The head tag should not contain any element that displays content (only metadata).
* Several hierarchical headings go from h1 to h6. In addition to making the text the biggest and boldest, the h1 tag is used by search indexers to locate the most crucial information about the webpage.
* Break lines and multiple spaces are comprised into a single whitespace. The 'p' tag is used to break several paragraphs.

## Day 003 - 2023/09/05

Today, I learned how to apply visual style (bold and italics) to text. The preferred way is using <strong> and <em> because these tags also change the semantics (the way screen readers pronounce the words).

## Day 004 - 2023/09/06

Today, I learned how to list items. There are two types of lists: ordered (ol) and unordered (ul). Within the tags of the list, use the tag (li) to add an item to the list. Nested lists are allowed.

## Day 005 - 2023/09/07

Today, I learned how to link to external and internal web pages. To include a link, use the <a> tag and specify in the href attribute the destination webpage.

## Day 006 - 2023/09/08

Today I learned how to display an image on a web page. Use the <img src='' alt=''> tag to include an image. The src attribute is the path of the image (can be relative or absolute, as with links; see day 005). The alt attribute is the description of the image in case the web browser cannot render the image.

## Day 007 - 2023/09/09

Today I learned how to change the style of individual elements, using CCS inline style. The style is defined in the opening tag with the syntax <p style="">. There are many CSS properties like color, font-size, text-alignment. You can find a complete list of CSS properties at https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/index.php.

## Day 008 - 2023/09/10

Today I learned how to change the style of all matching elements with the internal CCS style. Instead of styling each element as inline CSS, internal CSS creates a style for all the elements sharing one tag (selector).

## Day 009 - 2023/09/11

Today I learned CSS External Style. When you have multiple pages, the use of Internal CSS would require changing each individual file. With External CSS, you only need to make the changes in one file, despite the number of pages your website has.

## Day 009 - 2023/09/11

Today I learned to mix Inline, Internal, and External CSS Styles. The resolution order is the following: Inline, Internal, and External. That means Inline CSS Style will always be applied if there are conflicting attributes.
